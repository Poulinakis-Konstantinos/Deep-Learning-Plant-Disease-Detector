# Leaf-Disease-ML-detector-
Neural Network Model , based on transfer learning , able to detect diseases on plant's leaf images . 
The inference of the networks will be deployed on a RaspBerry Pi 4B (2gb Ram) equipped with a camera to create 
a portable disease detection device .   

 I write my code using Google Colab Notebooks . I design my Networks relying on Transfer Learning for training
 using Keras Applications. Language of choice is Python and Raspberry is running on Raspberry Pi OS (Linux distro).
 
 I have written scripts for :
 
        dataset preparation
        
        model compiling 
        
        model training 
        
        model saving-loading
        
        model automated testing on images I have picked . 
        
 All based on official site manuals.
